# Real Estate Market and Geolocation Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that focuses on analyzing real estate market trends and geolocation data. The notebook integrates data from two main sources: `corrected_geolocation.csv` and `market_analysis_2019.csv`.

## Dataset Descriptions
- **Corrected Geolocation Dataset:** This file contains geolocation data, presumably related to real estate properties or listings.
- **Market Analysis 2019 Dataset:** This dataset appears to involve real estate market analysis, including metrics such as revenue, occupancy, nightly rates, and more for different months of 2019.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The notebook includes cleaning and preprocessing steps for both datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** There is a focus on exploring trends, patterns, and correlations within the real estate market data, as well as analyzing geolocation aspects.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizes Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize findings, emphasizing temporal trends, geographical distributions, and market dynamics.
- **Statistical Analysis:** The notebook may contain statistical analyses to draw deeper insights from the data, such as seasonality in market trends or geographical influences on property values.
