## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/akhasanzoda/jupyter-notebooks-visualizations-machine-learning/
cd jupyter-notebooks-visualizations-machine-learning
```

### How to Run the Notebooks
1. Ensure you have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed, or use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html), which is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```
4. Navigate to the `[project name]/` directory and open the notebook you wish to run.
