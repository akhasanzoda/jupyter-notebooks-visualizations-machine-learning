# Obesity Level Analysis

This folder contains the analysis of a dataset related to obesity levels obtained from Kaggle. The project aims to uncover insights into obesity levels based on various factors and to predict obesity levels using machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:
- Age
- Gender
- Height
- Weight
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- PhysicalActivityLevel
- ObesityCategory

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning and preprocessing
- **SciPy**: Scientific computing and hypothesis testing
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations (not run in the environment, but provided code for use in user's environment)

## Tactics and Methodologies

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling categorical variables, normalizing data.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Checking for statistical significance in differences between groups.
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling for both regression (BMI prediction) and classification (Obesity Category prediction).
- **Clustering**: Employing K-Means clustering to identify inherent groupings in the data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using PCA for visualizing high-dimensional clustering results in two dimensions.

## Findings

1. The EDA revealed the distributions and relationships between various features related to obesity.
2. Hypothesis testing suggested no significant correlation between BMI and Physical Activity Level.
3. Regression modeling with Random Forest Regressor provided accurate predictions for BMI based on features.
4. Classification modeling with Random Forest Classifier showed high accuracy in predicting Obesity Categories.
5. Clustering identified distinct groups within the data, characterized by different mean values of features and most frequent categories.

## Conclusion

The analysis revealed valuable insights into factors associated with obesity levels. The machine learning models demonstrated the potential to predict individual obesity levels accurately. These findings could assist healthcare professionals in understanding and addressing obesity more effectively.
